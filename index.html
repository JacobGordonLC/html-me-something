        <h2> &lt&lt PLAYING &#62&#62 </h2>

            <h4> Early Years (5-12) </h4>

                <p> I began playing organized soccer at age 5 (kindergarden).
                    I played rec ball until I was 12 (6th grade) at Kent Parks and Recreation. 
                    Each season was typically two months September - Mid November.
                    My team was comprised mostly of schoolmates, many of them more athletic than me. 
                    For the first year (kindergarden), the team was coed. 
                    My Dad coached the team with a couple of parents as assistants.
                    We practiced at a nearby elementary school: Meadow Ridge.
                    Games were on the Kent Park soccer and baseball fields (what is now Showare Arena in Kent).
                    </p>

            <h4> Premier Level (12-18) </h4>

                <p> My older sister had had a year of premier soccer under her belt when I began to look.
                    I began looking at Maple Valley Force and Highline Premier FC (HPFC) - where my sister ended up (my Dad as assistant coach). 
                    I attended tryouts first at HPFC and then at Maple Valley.
                    HPFC tryouts were hosted at Highline HS Stadium.
                    I attended along with two of my former rec teammates.
                    One of my friends made the team, one got cut, and I made alternate.
                    Alternate meant that I could practice with the team but did not officially have a spot yet.
                    I had to hope a player declined their offer or dropped their spot, and
                    I had to hope I was better than the other 3 alternates.
                    I could have decided to play with Maple Valley, where I was comparably a much better player.
                    But, the players there didn't seem serious to me, and I wanted the challenge of a higher and more serious level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I trained with HPFC team for a month and a half. I was the most consistent alternate.
                    A player decided to quit, and I was offered the spot. I had made it on the team.
                    My struggle didn't end there, but with time I would find my place.
                    I never was a starter, nor did I get much playing time. But I loved it, and I stuck with it.
                    I played at Highline, under 2 different coaches, from the age of 12-17.
                    Playing with the players that I did has made me the player I've become.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was 16 and at a Highline fitness session, Darren Sawatzky, the Director of Coaching (DOC),
                    if there were any players that wanted to help be an assistant to a Rec Coach.
                    I offered and became an assistant to a WHSA U13 boys team coached by Joe Guerrero.
                    This was my first experience as a coach or teacher. I knew I loved it from the beginning.
                </p>
                <p> I finished out my premier career at the same club I had declined years earlier: Maple Valley. 
                    The coach, who I had always like, Body Kinney, was still the coach there, and he graciously made a spot for me.
                </p>

            <h4> High School (HS) Ball (14-18) </h4>

                <p>I went to Sequoia Jr. High in 9th grade, and played for the closest high school (HS) team,
                (Kent Meridian) since we did not have a team at Sequioa. I made JV and played all season.
                My sophomore year, I attended Kentlake HS, and was one of 2 captains for the JV team.
                My junior and senior year, I moved to Auburn Mountainview HS. Rules did not allow me to play varsity,
                so I played that year on JV (often practicing with the varsity team).
                My senior season, I was one of 4 captains on the varsity team. 
                I played for Cary Davidson, who had been program head coach at Kentlake and moved to Auburn Mountainview the year that I did.
                </p>

            <h4> Adult Soccer </h4>

                <p> 
                    I continued playing soccer - mostly adult rec and indoor soccer - after my premier level days.
                    I also played intramural soccer at Gonzaga. I continue to play to this day, but mostly I coach.
                </p>

        <h2> &#60&#60 COACHING &#62&#62 </h2> 

            <h4> Beginning </h4>

                <p> As I said before, I began coaching at the age of 16 at WHSA.
                    I would also occassionally help my HS coaches out by sharing
                    coaching ideas. After HS, while attending the local community college,
                    my HS Coach at Auburn Moutainview hired me and DJ Pogson as co-coaches
                    of the HS Boys C-team. I coached that team in the Fall of 2008.</p>
                
                <p> Later, in college, I worked with a girls U10 team (coached by Travis,
                    who I had met at my D-License in Spokane). Primarily, I got most of 
                    my experience working at the Sounders FC Youth Soccer Camps.
                    I worked there for three summers 2010-2012.
                </p>
                <p> When I came back home, I started working again at my HS, becoming the joint JV coach. 
                    I coached the boys from 2012-2014 and assisted the program in 2015 and 2016.
                    I also coached the girls JV in 2012 and got to assist the varsity that season while my younger sister Emily was on the team.
                    I assisted the girls in 2013 as well.
                </p>

            <h4> Club Coaching </h4>

                <p> I started club-coaching in ernest in 2013. I coached first in the Juniors
                    program at HPFC, under Maya Mendoza and TR Stoneback (Coerver Director). 
                    I would later become an assistant coach for Joe Patterson, coaching 3 teams.
                    I have coached at HPFC since 2014 and and still there today (2017-18 season). 
                    I have worked my way up from assistant coach, to head coach, to director.
                    I help run the club in all facets (business, management, soccer, etc.).
                </p>

            <h4> Coerver Coaching NW </h4>

                <p> Coerver Coaching NW is a footskills-based soccer program.
                    Having met TR Stoneback, the director, in the HPFC Juniors program in 2013,
                    I started shadowing these sessions (including Joe Patterson, who I assisted at HPFC in thee 2013-14 season)
                    for 3 months, and began working in June 2013. I have worked there on and off since.
                    It has made me a far better coach, and TRs brilliance has inspired in me a better 
                    love and sense of the game, as well as creativity, vision and enterpreneurship.
